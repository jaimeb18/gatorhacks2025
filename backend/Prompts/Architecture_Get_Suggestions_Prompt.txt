Name:
Find similar architecture works with style and cultural impact similar to {name} using the following guidelines, give two in the same city/region and four in the general area/country, for a total of six. For each place, create a list in the form [“Name”, “City/Location”, “Type of Architecture”, “Historical Era”, “Wikipedia”, “Link to Address on Google Maps”], replacing each string with the actual piece of information. Return only the six lists in valid Python list format like ["name1", "location1", "type_of_architecture1", "era1", "wikipedia1", “address1”], ["name2", "location2", "type_of_architecture2", "era2", "wikipedia2", “address2”], ...]. If one of these metrics is unknown, replace it with the exact string “Unknown”.
Use the following parameters as a guideline. Each suggestion should be highly similar in at least one of the parameters. Do not return only suggestions with the same functionality; include at least one half of the total responses that are of a different purpose. At least one sixth of the total responses should be of a different era, with a max difference of 150 years. At least one sixth of the total responses should be of a different style. Include at least one suggestion within the same area, which is in a different country, if within 150 miles; this distance requirement is only applicable for this suggestion.
