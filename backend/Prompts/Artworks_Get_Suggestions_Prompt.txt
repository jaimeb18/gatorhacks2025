Analyze the given artwork, {artwork}, and identify six similar artworks. The first four should be findable in the same city as {artwork}, and the last two should be findable in the same country. For each of the six artworks, create a list in the given form ["artwork", "artist", "year created", "current location", wikipedia link"], replacing each of the strings with the actual artwork, artist, year created, current location, and wikipedia link. Return ONLY the six lists in valid Python list format that can be parsed, like: [["artwork1", "artist1", "year1", "location1", "link1"], ["artwork2", "artist2", "year2", "location2", "link2"], ...] If {artwork} is not a known painting or sculpture, return simply "ERROR" and nothing else.
Use the following parameters as a guideline. Each suggestion should be highly related to at least one of the parameters. Do not return only suggestions with the same artist. Respond with a heavy bias towards style and color scheme rather than artist. At least one half of the artworks should be of the same medium/materials. At least one half of the artworks should be of a highly similar subject matter.
