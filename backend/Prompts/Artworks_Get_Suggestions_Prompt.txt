Analyze the given artwork, {artwork} and return similar artwork according to the following guidelines.
Return six responses, four from the same city, two from the same area.
Create a list in the given form ["artwork", "artist", "year created", "current location", wikipedia link"], for each artwork, replacing each string with the actual piece of information.
Return only the six lists in valid Python list format that can be parsed, like: [["artwork1", "artist1", "year1", "location1", "link1"], ["artwork2", "artist2", "year2", "location2", "link2"], ...].
If one of these metrics is unknown, replace it with the exact string “Unknown”.
Each suggestion should be related to at least one of the parameters.
Respond with a heavy bias towards style and color scheme rather than artist.
At least one half of the artworks should be of the same medium/materials.
At least one half of the artworks should be of a highly similar subject matter.
At least one third of the artworks should be by a different artist.
